# Contributing to Aurelia

## Development Philosophy

Aurelia is built using AI-assisted development, which allows us to move quickly while maintaining high code quality. We believe in:

- Rapid iteration and continuous deployment
- Code quality and maintainability
- Scalable and secure architecture
- Data-driven decision making
- Automated testing and validation

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

   ```

## Development Process

### AI-Assisted Development

We use AI tools to accelerate development while maintaining code quality. Our process includes:

1. **Planning**: Define features and requirements
2. **Implementation**: Use AI to generate initial code
3. **Review**: Manual code review and testing
4. **Refinement**: Iterate and improve the implementation
5. **Documentation**: Update docs and add comments

### Code Quality Standards

- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint for code consistency
- Prettier for formatting
- Comprehensive testing
- Clear documentation

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch
2. Make your changes
3. Run tests and linting
4. Submit a pull request
5. Address review comments
6. Merge when approved

## Testing

We use a combination of:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- End-to-end tests
- Manual testing

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test
```
