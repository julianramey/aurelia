 Project Development Rules
User-First, Friction-Free

Every screen and flow (onboarding, media-kit editor, brand search, pitch tool) must minimize clicks and fields.

Default sensible values wherever possible; only ask for truly essential data.

One Source of Truth

All styling (colors, fonts, spacing) lives in Tailwind/CSS-vars and theme configs—no hard-coded values.

Components consume only design tokens and utility classes; no inline hexes or magic numbers.

Schema Completeness

Every user-editable piece of data (profile info, media-kit sections, theme colors) must be declared in the Cursor/Supabase schema.

Use clear, consistent field names; wrap optional sections in conditionals.

Incremental & Atomic

Each PR tackles a single mini-project or clearly scoped chunk (e.g. “Seed brand DB + discovery UI” or “Media-kit color-theming overhaul”).

Avoid cross-cutting changes that touch unrelated features in one commit.

Production-Ready Out of the Box

Code must build and run without errors, both locally and in CI.

Include error handling, loading states, and retry logic for all network requests.

Consistency & Reuse

Reuse UI components for cards, buttons, forms, etc., with props for variants (size, tone).

Follow the existing component API patterns (e.g. <Card>, <Button variant="outline">).

Performance & Responsiveness

Keep bundle size low—lazy-load large modules (brand DB, pitch templates) where appropriate.

Ensure layouts work seamlessly on mobile (≤ 640px), tablet, and desktop.

Visibility & Feedback

Show spinners or skeletons during async fetches.

Confirm actions (e.g. “Pitch sent”, “Profile saved”) with non-blocking toasts.

Data Integrity & Security

Validate inputs both client-side and server-side (Supabase rules).

Never expose Pro-only fields (verified contacts) to Starter users.

Ship Fast, Iterate Faster

Merge MVP functionality quickly; gather real user feedback.

Prioritize analytics and error-tracking hooks (e.g. email opens) in v2, not v1.
